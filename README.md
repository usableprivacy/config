# UP Box 4 Configuration Tool
___
This tool installs and configures the basic building blocks of the **[Usable Privacy Box (v4)](https://upribox.org)**.<br>
Use this tool to **filter ads and trackers** in your home network and to **protect your DNS traffic** against analysis and monitoring.


**Notable Building Blocks**
 - [Knot Resolver](https://github.com/CZ-NIC/knot-resolver) for `caching` and `DNS over TLS (DoT)` 
 - [Pi-holeÂ®](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) for network-wide `ad blocking`.
 - [UP Config Utility](https://github.com/usableprivacy/config)  for configuration via `CLI`

**DNS Configuration Options**<br>

[Knot Resolver](https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides `caching`, `DNSSEC validation`, `QNAME Minimization`, and `IPv6 support` by default.

The UP Box Configuration Tool ships four different DNS configurations:
 * `plain`: Unencrypted DNS to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns).
 * `recursive`: Recursive resolver with unencrypted DNS to [Authoritative DNS server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Authoritative_name_server). 
 * `mix`: **Encrypted DNS** over TLS split between [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/), [Applied Privacy](https://applied-privacy.net/services/dns/) [Digitale Gesellschaft](https://www.digitale-gesellschaft.ch/dns/), [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/). 
 * `private`: **Encrypted DNS** over TLS split between [Applied Privacy](https://applied-privacy.net/services/dns/), [Digitale Gesellschaft](https://www.digitale-gesellschaft.ch/dns/).

The four configuration options are loosely sorted by the privacy-protection they offer. 
The `plain` configuration is the least privacy-friendly option but may offer the best performance. The `private` configuration offers the strongest privacy protection.
We recommend the `mix` configuration for the best balance between privacy and performance.
